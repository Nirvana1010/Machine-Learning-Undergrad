# Undergraduate Machine Learning Projects 

**Language:** Python
**IDE:** PyCharm

## Overview
Basic Machine Learning regression and classification models built `from scratch`. Topics includes:
- [K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](/Project1/)
- [Linear Regression](/Project2/)
- [Parameter Estimation / Non-parameter estimation](/Project3/)
- [Naive Bayes](/Project4/)
- [Hierarchical Clustering](/Project5/)
- [Decision Tree (CART / C4.5)](/Project6/)
- [Feature Selection leveraging Relief-F / MRMR algorithms](/Project7/)
    - Perform feature selection on the given dataset and classify the data after feature selection using four classifiers KNN, NB, SVM, Random Forests. Plot the classification accuracy and AUC values.
